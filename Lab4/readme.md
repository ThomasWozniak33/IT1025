## Executive Summary 
In lab 4 I we learn a lot more on Python coding that I probably have never heard about before. Not only that but also the introduction to graphics which is extremely exciting to me.
## Python IDLE
A shell is code in command line in Linux and a file is for where you but the command line code at, so you do not repeatedly enter the command. An editor lets you edit.
## Code Examples
### Variable:Holds one or more values of code so you write one thing beside writing it over and over.
### Assignment statement:This is to simple give something a name.
### Function:Stores code  into whatever you define it as so you don’t repeat it again and again almost like a variable but not at all.
### Three data types:: Numeric, Set, and Dictionary.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster is made of tiny little pixels where on the other hand vector is digital art using a mathematical formula.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless doesn’t give any lost of quality to the image but the file is larger and if you don’t want large files, you would use lossy compression yet that would lower the quality. 
### File Formats
JPEG-Reduces area of the photo into blocks of pixels
PNG-supports both bit color numbers and let you do transparency on photos.
GIF-Gif has a color palette of 256 and is lower quality but supports animation
Both PNG and GIF support 8-bit color
Both PNG and JPEG support 24-bit color
Both GIF and JPEG are older formats
### File Properties

In properties you can find things like the type of file ,location, size, when it was created, and its name.
## Conclusion
At the end of this lab, I have learned all about the introduction to graphics and a deeper dive into Python. With Python I can know what functions and variables are plus their differences. Also, with Python how to write a little more advanced code. When it comes to the graphics section, I not only made my own logo but learn the different file types for photos and there differences.
